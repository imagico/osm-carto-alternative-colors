# List of patterns and their default adjustments
#
# darken:
# The value by which the original color is darkened for the pattern foreground
# This value should always be negative.
#
# brighten_darken_ratio:
# The pattern foreground occupies less space than the background. So lightening
# the background has to be less intense than darkening the foreground. This
# value is multiplied with the negative value of "darken" to get a value for
# "brighten", so brighten_darken_ration must also be negative to make sure
# the "brighten" result is positive. This value should (only) be changed when
# the pattern itself is changed.
